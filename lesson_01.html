  <h1>Lesson One: Change the Time</h1>

  <p>
    We've wired up the display and so far all we see is... "0:00." Exciting.
  </p>

  <p>
    What we might want to see is the current time. If we're going to change what is being
    displayed, we first need to change the code. Open up http://YourHostName:9003/,
    where "YourHostName" is actually the hostname or IP address of the Raspberry Pi
    that you will be using. Your instructor should have it written down somewhere, so
    if you don't know this info please ask! Once you load this address into a web browser
    you should see the following:
  </p>

  <img id="index_page" src="/images/index_page.png" alt="Screenshot of the index page"/>

  <p>
    The first thing we want to do is edit the clock's code. Click on the blue title that
    says "Edit the clock's code" and the code for your clock should appear.
  </p>

  <img id="edit_code" src="/images/edit_code.png" alt="Screenshot of editing code"/>

  <p>
    What you see now is the Python code for the clock. Python is a programming language
    that is intended to be easily to read and easy to understand. For right now we can
    ignore the first few lines that say "import" at the top, and skip down to where we
    "Connect to the internal machine clock."
  </p>

  <p>
    Notice that there are a few lines in this code that start with the "#" symbol. This
    means that the line is ignored by the computer, and is reffered to as a "comment."
    Comments are for humans like you and I to read so we can better communicate what
    the code is doing, but the machines that read our code will completely ignore them.
    The comment says we are "connecting to the internal machine clock," but the actual
    action of connecting happens on the line directly underneath.
  </p>

  <p>
    The line underneath says <pre>clock = Clock()</pre> and is the first machine-readable
    line of code we care about. This one line actually has two parts: a <i>variable</i>
    and a <i>constructor</i>. If we read this line from right to left, the "Clock()" phrase
    <i>constructs</i> a new <i>object</i>. Here we're telling our machine to "build" a
    new Clock object that will keep time for us and let us know when the seconds go by.
    The "=" sign <i>assigns</i> this newly constructed object to a variable. Our
    <i>variable</i> is named "clock," and it allows us to store and keep our newly
    created objects. If we were reading this out loud, we might say "the variable
    'clock' is a newly constructed Clock object."
  </p>

  <p>
    The following line does a similar thing, except instead of creating a new Clock
    we are creating a new Display object. This new object will be responsible for updating
    the digits on our bright LED display and letting people see what time it is.
  </p>

  <p>
    Skip ahead and look at the rest of the code. Note that the rest of our file
    has lines that begin with "display.something()." When you see a line begin with
    "display." it means that we are using the display <i>object</i> to call a <i>method</i>.
    <i>Methods</i> are actions taken on an objects. When we type
    <pre>display.setColon(True)</pre>, this is telling the machine "using the
    display <i>object</i>, set the colon lights to 'on.'" This should light up the
    colon indicator in the middle of the LED display.
  </p>

  <p>
    Reading from top to bottom, we can see that we are telling the display to turn on
    the colon lights, turn off the evening indicator ("set(False)" means turn it off),
    set the hours digits to "0," set the minutes digits to "0" and set the brightness
    level to "1."
  </p>

  <p>
    Now let's change the minutes and hours digits that are showing on the display.
    Change the hours to "12":
    <pre>display.setHours(12)</pre>
    and set the minutes to "33":
    <pre>display.setMinutes(33)</pre>
    After that is changed in your code, click on the save button in the top-right
    corner: <img id="save" src="/images/save.png" alt="Save Button"/>.
  </p>

  <p>
    Once you save your changes, the clock should re-start itself. The display will blink,
    and you should see it now display "12:33." Congratulations! You've
