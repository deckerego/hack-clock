  <h1>Hack Your Alarm Clock</h1>

  <p>
    Kids, teens and adults are more inspired to tinker after they learn the basic
    framework of what they are tinkering with. Electronics and circuit sets are great,
    but it really helps to jump-start learning with demos or projects that are heavily
    documented in the box. After you get your bearings on what works and what breaks,
    you are more free to experiment and add your own ideas.

    In that spirit, I am working on a hackable alarm clock based on the Raspberry Pi
    platform along with several Adafruit/Sparkfun components. The idea is that we
    can build a customized, tricked-out bedroom alarm clock with some general
    off-the-shelf components to see how hardware and software work in concert to
    create something useful. After the project is done, I'm hoping its creators
    will feel inspired to rip it apart or build new features using the pieces.
