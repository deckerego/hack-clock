  <h1>Lesson Four: Play Lists</h1>

  <p>
    Now we are going to have our alarm clock play music. Once we have our
    amplifier and speakers wired up, it is time to create a list of audio files
    for our alarm clock to play.
  </p>

  <p>
    First, let's take a look at our "Upload Audio" page by clicking on the
    top navigation bar. Once the page appears we should be able to see a list
    of files that are already loaded on our Hack Clock, and also a button
    to upload our own files. Right now we are going to use the two files that
    came with the Hack Clock - AmicusMeus.ogg and TestTrack.ogg.

  <p>
    Let's return back to our "Edit Code" page by clicking it in the top navigation
    bar. Let's create a new function, this time to play music:
  </p>

  <code>
    from hackclock.runapp.Libs.GStreamer import Speaker

    # Connect to the speaker
    speaker = Speaker()

    # Play some music
      def playMusic():
      speaker.playList()
  </code>

  <p>
    We want to tell the speaker what audio files play. We don't want to have
    just one file either - we want to provide an entire play list. Python can
    create lists of elements by containing each item in [] brackets, then separating
    each element with a comma. For example:
  </p>

  <code>
    # Play some music
      def playMusic():
      speaker.playList(["TestTrack.ogg", "AmicusMeus.ogg"])
  </code>

  <p>
    The change in the code above will create a list with the names of two tracks,
    TestTrack and AmicusMeus. This list then is sent to the speaker's function
    playList, which will play each track in order.
  </p>

  <p>
    Next, let's tell our Hack Clock to start this playlist at 9:30 in the morning
    so we can wake up to our lovely music. Here we can inform the clock that we want
    our playMusic function to be called at a specific time:
  </p>

  <code>
    # Wake us up at 8:30 in the morning
    clock.atTime(8, 30, playMusic)
  </code>

  <p>
    Excellent! Now at 8:30 in the morning our clock will begin blasting some music.
    Change the time to just a minute in the future - see if it will begin playing!
  </p>

  <p>
    Now we need to learn how to add some new hardware to our clock: let's have our clock
    <a href="05_temperature.html">tell us the temperature outside when we press a button</a>.
  </p>
