  <h1>"Internet of Things" Automation with IFTTT</h1>

  <p>
    The Hack Clock can integrate with the automation service
    <a href="https://ifttt.com">IFTTT.com</a> to turn your lights on
    when your alarm goes off, send out a tweet at the press of a button,
    or fire up your coffee maker at a given time.
  </p>

  <p>
    To turn on IFTTT within your toolbox, you will need to use the
    <a href="https://ifttt.com/services/maker_webhooks/settings">Maker service</a>
    within IFTTT and have it generate a new webhook key for you. Once you do,
    add it to <code>/etc/hack-clock.conf</code> as in:
  </p>

  <code>
        "ifttt_maker_key": "sdfafd_aDAKDF_wadfs",
  </code>

  <p>
    Once you have changed your config file, re-start the hack-clock service
    to read in the new file. After the restart, you should be able to add
    the following code to your Python file:
  </p>

  <code>
    ifttt = IFTTT(configuration.get('ifttt_maker_key'))

    def wakeUp():
      if not (datetime.now().weekday() in (5, 6)):
        ifttt.sendMakerEvent("sara_light")
        playMusic()
  </code>

  <p>
    The above code will send an event to a Maker-powered IFTTT Applet, which then
    turns on an LIFX light:
