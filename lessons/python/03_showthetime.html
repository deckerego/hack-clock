  <h1>Lesson Three: Keep Updating the Current Time</h1>

  <p>
    The clock now shows whatever we tell it - but how do we get it to always show
    the current time?
  </p>

  <p>
    The first step is to find a way to ask our computer for the current time. First
    we need to ask Python to give us the datetime library, so towards the top of our
    code we need to add:
    <pre>import datetime</pre>
    Now that we have the datetime library imported, we can fetch the current time
    using:
    <pre>now = datetime.datetime.now()</pre>
    Do you recognize what "now" means from our previous lesson? "now" is a
    <i>variable</i> that stores what the current time is. You can read the line
    "datetime.datetime.now()" as "run the method 'now()' on the datetime object
    inside of the datetime library." It may seem like a long way of doing it, but
    this stores the current time in the "now" variable so we can use it later.
  </p>

  <p>
    If we want to pull out the minutes of our new "now" variable, we can access
    its "minute" and "hour" properties. For example, to get the current hour,
    we would type in:
    <pre>now.hour</pre>
    If we wanted to make our clock show the current hour and minute
    on our display, we would use:
    <pre>
      display.setHours(now.hour)
      display.setMinutes(now.minute)
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    Fantastic! We can how show the current minutes and hours on our display!
    There's just one problem: this only sets the time on the display <i>once</i>
    when the clock starts up - it never changes!
  </p>

  <p>
    First let's clean up our code a bit. We're going to create a function to display
    the current time by moving our code into a function. Replace your old "display.setHours"
    and "display.setMinutes" code with a new method of your creation:

    <pre>
def showCurrentTime():
    now = datetime.datetime.now()

    # Set the hours
    display.setHours(now.hour)

    # Set the indicator lights
    display.setColon(True)

    # Set the minutes
    display.setMinutes(now.minute)

showCurrentTime()
    </pre>

    This will still only change the display once, but this cleans up our code a bit
    and will make it easier to set the current time over and over again. Save
    your work, and make sure the clock is still showing the time on its display.
  </p>

  <p>
    To keep displaying the current time we need to listen to the "ticks" of the
    computer's internal clock. To do this we are going to use the "Clock" object
    we created earlier and tell it to call our function every time the clock "ticks."
    In this case one tick is almost one second - so our code is going to tell our
    clock to update itself about once every second.
  </p>

  <p>
    Instead of calling the "showCurrentTime" function right away, instead tell
    the clock to call it using the following code that replaces the old:
    <pre>
# Show the current time
def showCurrentTime():
    now = datetime.datetime.now()

    # Set the hours
    display.setHours(now.hour)

    # Set the indicator lights
    display.setColon(True)

    # Set the minutes
    display.setMinutes(now.minute)

# What to do when the internal clock ticks
clock.onTick(showCurrentTime)
    </pre>
  </p>

  <p>
    Save your changes and watch your clock carefully. The time should now update when the minutes change!
  </p>
